	Uprobes test readme. 
-------------------------------------------
Requirements
-----------
All tests need debugfs mounted 
	(i.e kernel should be built with CONFIG_DEBUG_FS option set)
	debugfs can be mounted by the below command
		"mount -t debugfs debugfs /sys/kernel/debug"

Also dejagnu and expect need to be installed.

How to Run:
-----------
Run "make check" to compile and run tests.

Run "runtest --tool uprobes" 
	(or  "runtest" ) to run tests.

Run "make" or "make default" to just compile tests.
	
See results in uprobes.sum (summary) and uprobes.log.
	(if --tool option is not used.  or testrun.sum (summary) 
	and testrun.log )

To run a single test
-------------------
runtest --tool uprobes <path to expect script>

For example:
runtest --tool uprobes ./uprobes.w/10k_iterations.exp
